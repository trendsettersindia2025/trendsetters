IMPORTANT: Founder Image Setup
==============================

The founder's photo has been added back to the About page.

To complete the setup:
1. Save the founder's photo as "founder.jpg"
2. Place it in the "images" folder in the website directory
3. The image path in the HTML is: images/founder.jpg

The HTML has been updated to display the image in the leadership section.

Note: The image shown appears to be Mr. Girish Purdhani in a black polo shirt standing in what looks like a hotel or hospitality setting with decorative flowers in the background.
